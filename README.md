# Currency Converter Challenge

### #AluraLatam #OracleNextEducation #AluraChallenge
Hello! this is my solution for the Alura challenge called: "Currency Converter".

If you want to use this project you will need:

- Java 17 (As minimum).
- A Console (I recommend Tilix).

This project was created using:

- Java LTS 17.
- [Lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna).
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson).
- [exchangerate-api](https://www.exchangerate-api.com).

**The exchangerate-api is a free API that you can use to get a lot of currency
conversion. Please see the link and create an account to use your own key in the
project, you can use a free account or if you want you can get a plan, and you 
will get more advantages.**

The JAR is in `/out` directory. Once you are in that directory 
please run the following command:

```bash
java -jar CurrencyConverter.jar
```

and that's all. You will see something like this:

This is the Main menu. If you want to move and select an option press
:arrow_up: and :arrow_down: keys, and press enter to get into the option.
